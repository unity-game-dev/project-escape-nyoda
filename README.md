<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
<img src="Escape NYODA/Assets/gameSC.jpeg" alt="Escape NYDOA in-game screenshot">
<br/>

"Escape NYODA" is an awesome survival platformer game which takes visual inspiration from retro 1-bit and 8-bit games. The music also gives off players the retro vibes.
The game is set in a futuristic, abandoned 1-bit nuclear powerplant with biotech enemies filled with rage. This is a single player game where the player has to survive and get out of a power plant with optimal use of available resources and defeating enemies.

<br/>

This prototype/demo involves only the first stage of the actual game idea that we proposed where the players become familiar with the mechanics of the game.
